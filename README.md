Creative Portion:
- don't allow messages containing certain curse words (like the f word) to go through in the chat

- an option for a creator of a room to change the name of a chatroom
(Note: Only the creator of the room can change the name of the chatroom!)

- an option for a creator of a room to remove a chatroom
(Note: Only the creator of the room can remove the chatroom!)

- an option to disconnect a user if they're being particularly bad (erase their name from all chatrooms, and freeze that user's screen so that they cannot chat/enter rooms at all)


Note: we used some code from this tutorial: http://psitsmike.com/2011/10/node-js-and-socket-io-multiroom-chat-tutorial/. Whenever we took code from it to use, we cited it in our code for any block we used it from. Based on the academic integrity policy, I hope our citations are okay.

Note 2: The messages and updates in the actual chat screen are all the way at the bottom of the html past all the buttons and textboxes.
