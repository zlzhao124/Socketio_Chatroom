Creative Portion:
- don't allow messages containing certain curse words (like the f word) to go through in the chat

- an option to disconnect a user if they're being particularly bad (erase their name from all chatrooms)

- an option for a creator of a room to change the name of a chatroom

Note: we used some code from this tutorial: http://psitsmike.com/2011/10/node-js-and-socket-io-multiroom-chat-tutorial/. Whenever we took code from it to use, we cited it in our code, and I hope the amount we used isn't . Based on the academic integrity policy, I hope this is okay.
